# AOC 2021

https://adventofcode.com/2021

## Day 01

adding basic lib as you always need something like this in AOC :)
Learning/Fun: start using https://github.com/spf13/cobra 

## Day 02

Easy. Need refactoring for cobra and stuff....

## Day 03

Remove Cobra.... learned enough and it´s "Kanonen auf Spatzen" in this context

## Day 04

baking cookies while programming is not very efficient...

## Day 05

wasted lots of time for stupid bug (didn´t clear data for part2 -> double adding lines ....) :(

## Day 06

First solution was not scalable. After rethinking I found a trivial way to implement.

## Day 07

Solution Part 1 should be fine but right now ther server is broken... waiting for input data.....
Server is up and running again: Solution was bad, because of bad reading by me.... (Return Fuel and NOT Position)

## Day 08

This was tough... not really programming but analysing combinations of 7-Segment-Displays.
Didn´t really like it though

## Day 09

Easy with a "border" around the input and some recursion...

## Day 10

Took some time to get the best idea to follow. Stack was the right choice :)
There are lots of beautifing options but hey..... (maybe later)

## Day 11

Easy

## Day 12

Cheated.... had the right idea with data structure but didn´t get the recursion right...
Had to do some working besides AOC2021 so I took the work from https://github.com/pvainio/adventofcode/blob/main/2021/go/d12/main.go 

## Day 13

That was fun and not too hard to implement...

## Day 14
